## Upgrade your project

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
If you have time, you can add more steps to the tutorial and customise the style to your preferences.

At the moment your tutorial only has one step! The starter project includes images for additional steps.

There are images called `happy.png` and `annoyed.png`.

You can use these descriptions or write your own:

+ **happy**: 'A happy expression in anime uses two thick curved lines for the eyes and a wide mouth to create a happy, laughing face.'
+ **annoyed**: 'An annoyed facial expression can be made by pointing the eyebrows down towards the centre. The eyes use a thick line with a semi-circle underneath. The mouth is slightly curved.'

Create a new `<section>` for each new tutorial step. Look at the section you have already created to remind yourself of the HTML tags and CSS classes you need to use.

You can also change:

+ The colour palette to `default` or `candy`.

+ The colours in the colour palette CSS file. *Tip:** You can find [new hex colours](https://rpf.io/colours){:target="_blank"} to use.

+ As well as hex colours, you can also use colour names such as 'teal' and 'coral'.

+ The size of the fonts used. `1rem` is normal font size. `3rem` is three times as big.

+ Try different border effects in the `dashed-border` style or switch to the `solid-border` class.
